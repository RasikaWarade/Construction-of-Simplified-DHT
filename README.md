# Construction-of-Simplified-DHT

Distributed Hashtables (DHTs) are structured peer-to-peer (P2P) systems that have demonstrable scaling properties. The simplified DHT that I built uses information about a small subset – O(log N) – of peers within the system to make local decisions that ensure efficient routing of messages. This effort included development of wire formats for several control and data plane messages to construct routing tables and route content. DHTs are often used to support discovery and lookup services at scale. (Java)
